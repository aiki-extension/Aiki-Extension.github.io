Aiki is a martial arts principle that allows a practitioner to redirect an opponent's power back against themselves. 

Aiki is also a browser extension that considers social media (and other time-wasting websites) as the oponent that needs to be fought back against.

This project helps an internet user take advantage of their habits of visiting time-wasting web sites and consider the (often involuntary) impulses of visiting the said websites as a reminder for doing something useful, e.g. learning Danish or getting better at programming in Python. What is useful for each user, it is up to them to decide.

​Aiki @ CHI 2023

Nanna, Bjørn, John and I have a new paper on Aiki at CHI'23: Challenges and Opportunities of Using Redirection of Activity for Self-Regulation Online

It investigates how Aiki 2.0 -- an improved version of Aiki in terms of usability -- fares to help people drop procrastination and instead learn programming with the help of micro-learning activities. 

Another awesome video directed by Nanna that presents the highlights of the paper:
