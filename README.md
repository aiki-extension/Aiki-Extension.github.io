**Aiki** is a **martial arts principle** that allows a practitioner to redirect an opponent’s power back against themselves.

**Aiki** is also a **browser extension** that considers social media (and other time-wasting websites) as the oponent that needs to be fought back against using the Aiki principle.

Aiki is also our **research project** that aims to investigate whether the Aiki extension can help an internet user take advantage of their habits of visiting time-wasting web sites and use the (often involuntary) impulses of visiting said websites as a reminder for doing something useful, e.g. learning Danish or getting better at programming in Python. What is useful for each user, it is up to them to decide.


## Aiki @ CHI 2023

A new paper about Aiki at CHI'23: [**Challenges and Opportunities of Using Redirection of Activity for Self-Regulation Online**](https://mircealungu.com/docs/assets/papers/Aiki-CHI23.pdf)

It investigates how Aiki 2.0 -- an improved version of Aiki in terms of usability -- fares to help people drop procrastination and instead learn programming with the help of micro-learning activities. 

Another awesome video directed by Nanna that presents the highlights of the paper:

## Aiki @ CHI 2021

The paper we published at CHI'21 about Aiki, [**Aiki: Turning Procrastination into Microlearning**](https://mircealungu.com/docs/assets/papers/Aiki-CHI21.pdf), shows that: 
- People who want to learn Danish can use redirection from time-wasting-websites as a strategy and cue to remember that they should learn
 - Participants learned quite a bit of Danish and some of them actually found the learning a better use of their time than the 'mindless' scrolling on Facebook


[Nanna Inie](https://pure.itu.dk/en/persons/nanna-inie) directed an amazing video showcasing Aiki for the CHI'21 presentation.
